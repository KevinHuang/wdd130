      I'm Kevin Huang, coming from Taiwan. Alongside being a proud father of
      four boys, I have a deep passion for both basketball and computer
      programming.

      After several years of computer programming experience, I've discovered
      that web design is quite unique. For an engineer like me who's familiar
      with backend technologies and focuses on data processing logic, web design
      is a completely different field. HTML and CSS, through their declarative
      syntax, can create powerful and beautiful user interfaces, which has left
      a strong impression on me.

      I'm very grateful to be in the same course with all of you, and I believe I can learn a lot from each of you. May we encourage each other and progress together.
